# Docker-Nginx-Proxy
SITE SSL on DOCKER - Nginx Proxy is an automated solution for obtaining and deploying free Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS certificates in your Docker containers. This is achieved by using an Nginx Proxy container that acts as a gateway, routing traffic to your services, and a second container that handles certificate retrieval and renewal automatically.
